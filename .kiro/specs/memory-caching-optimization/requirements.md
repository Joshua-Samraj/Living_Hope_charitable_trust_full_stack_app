# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements memory caching optimization for the Living Hope Charitable Trust website to significantly reduce loading times and improve user experience. The system will implement both client-side and server-side caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing database queries and API calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want pages to load quickly without delays, so that I can efficiently browse projects, gallery items, and donation information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL load content within 2 seconds for cached data
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL display cached content immediately while refreshing in the background
3. WHEN a user accesses frequently viewed content THEN the system SHALL serve it from memory cache without database queries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want the system to automatically manage cached data, so that users always see up-to-date information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated in the admin panel THEN the system SHALL invalidate related cache entries immediately
2. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it from the database
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL rebuild essential cache data on startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable cache settings, so that I can optimize performance based on data access patterns and server resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring cache settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting TTL (time-to-live) for different data types
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
3. WHEN cache size reaches maximum THEN the system SHALL automatically remove oldest entries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the latest project updates and gallery images, so that I stay informed about the trust's activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new projects are added THEN the system SHALL update the cache within 5 minutes
2. WHEN gallery images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL refresh the gallery cache immediately
3. WHEN donation information changes THEN the system SHALL invalidate donation-related cache entries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor cache performance, so that I can optimize the caching strategy and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL log cache hits and misses
2. WHEN cache performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on hit ratios and response times
3. WHEN debugging cache issues THEN the system SHALL provide cache status and contents through admin endpoints
