# Bulk Delete Feature for Gallery Images

## Overview
The gallery management system now supports bulk deletion of multiple images, allowing administrators to efficiently manage large collections of images by selecting and deleting multiple items at once.

## Features

### Backend Implementation
- **Bulk Delete Endpoint**: `DELETE /gallery` with request body containing image IDs
- **Validation**: Ensures image IDs array is provided and not empty
- **Database Operation**: Uses MongoDB's `deleteMany()` for efficient bulk deletion
- **Response**: Returns count of successfully deleted images vs requested count

### Frontend Implementation
- **Selection Interface**: Checkboxes for individual and bulk selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected images are highlighted with blue border and background
- **Bulk Actions Bar**: Shows selection count and provides clear/delete actions
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions with confirmation prompt

## User Interface

### AdminDashboard Gallery Tab
- **Grid View**: Images displayed in responsive grid layout
- **Selection Checkboxes**: Individual checkboxes on each image
- **Select All**: Master checkbox to select/deselect all images
- **Bulk Actions**: Delete selected images with confirmation
- **Visual Indicators**: Selected images have blue highlighting

### GalleryEditPage (Detailed Management)
- **Table View**: Organized by categories with expandable sections
- **Category Selection**: Select all images within a specific category
- **Individual Actions**: Edit and delete buttons for each image
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple images across categories

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Controller (`galleryController.js`)
```javascript
const deleteMultipleImages = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { imageIds } = req.body;
    
    if (!imageIds || !Array.isArray(imageIds) || imageIds.length === 0) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Image IDs array is required' });
    }

    const deleteResult = await Gallery.deleteMany({ _id: { $in: imageIds } });
    
    res.json({ 
      message: `Successfully deleted ${deleteResult.deletedCount} images`,
      deletedCount: deleteResult.deletedCount,
      requestedCount: imageIds.length
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

### Frontend Service (`galleryService.ts`)
```typescript
deleteMultipleImages: async (imageIds: string[]): Promise<{
  message: string; 
  deletedCount: number; 
  requestedCount: number 
}> => {
  try {
    const response = await api.delete('/gallery', {
      data: { imageIds }
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting multiple gallery images:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### State Management
- **selectedImages**: Set<string> to track selected image IDs
- **selectAll**: Boolean for master checkbox state
- **isDeleting**: Boolean to show loading state during deletion

## Usage Workflow

### For Administrators
1. **Navigate** to Admin Dashboard â†’ Gallery tab
2. **Select Images**:
   - Click individual checkboxes on images
   - Use "Select All" for bulk selection
   - Mix and match selections as needed
3. **Review Selection**: See count of selected images in the actions bar
4. **Delete**: Click "Delete Selected" button
5. **Confirm**: Confirm deletion in the dialog prompt
6. **Result**: View success message with deletion count

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Click Image**: Toggle selection
- **Checkbox Click**: Direct selection (prevents event bubbling)

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Single image: "Are you sure you want to delete this image?"
- Multiple images: "Are you sure you want to delete X selected images?"

### Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to user
- Partial failures are reported (e.g., "3 of 5 images deleted")
- Authentication checks prevent unauthorized deletions

### Visual Feedback
- Selected images have blue highlighting
- Loading states during deletion process
- Success/error messages after operations

## API Endpoints

### Delete Multiple Images
- **Method**: DELETE
- **URL**: `/gallery`
- **Headers**: Authorization required
- **Body**: `{ "imageIds": ["id1", "id2", "id3"] }`
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Successfully deleted 3 images",
    "deletedCount": 3,
    "requestedCount": 3
  }
  ```

### Error Responses
- **400**: Invalid or missing image IDs array
- **401**: Unauthorized (not logged in)
- **404**: No images found with provided IDs
- **500**: Server error during deletion

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations
- Single `deleteMany()` operation instead of multiple `deleteOne()` calls
- Indexed `_id` field for efficient lookups
- Batch processing reduces database round trips

### Frontend Optimization
- Set-based selection tracking for O(1) lookup performance
- Efficient re-rendering with React state management
- Minimal DOM updates during selection changes

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Delete multiple images in one operation
2. **User Experience**: Intuitive selection interface
3. **Safety**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidents
4. **Performance**: Optimized database operations
5. **Flexibility**: Works across different view modes (grid/table)
6. **Feedback**: Clear success/error messaging
